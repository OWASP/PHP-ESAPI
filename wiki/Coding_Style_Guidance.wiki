To avoid various formats and usages that make it tricky to maintain that code, it's important for all code to meet a single coding style standard. 

While indentation and style don't have much to do with bugs (other than mandatory bracing for all blocks), it does have a lot to do with maintainability. Our code should be internally consistent if nothing else as it makes it simpler to contribute, maintain and review code. 

The coding style for the ESAPI for PHP project is: PEAR - widely adopted by most projects. Many IDEs contain this choice as a default: http://pear.php.net/manual/en/standards.php

The coding style guidelines cover areas including:

  * Indenting and Line Length
  * Control Structures
  * Function Calls
  * Class Definitions
  * Function Definitions
  * Arrays
  * Comments
  * Including Code
  * PHP Code Tags
  * Header Comment Blocks
  * Using SVN
  * Example URLs
  * Naming Conventions
  * File Formats
  * E_STRICT-compatible code
  * Error Handling Guidelines
  * Best practices
